# Monolith UI migration status

Last updated: 2026-07-29

## Current milestone

The production migration foundation plus batches 001 through 003 and batch 005
(Accounting) are implemented and verified. Batch 004 (Expense and CHA) remains
implemented with its source, archive, type, focused test, and production-build
gates recorded; its historical connected-Browser visual matrix remains
unrecorded. Accounting has passed a complete authenticated Playwright matrix
covering every discovered route in every required theme and viewport.

- Source audit: 211 page routes and 13 layouts.
- Protected visual reference: `/dashboard`.
- Migrated routes: `/account/security`, `/admin/design-system`,
  `/notifications`, `/product-catalogue`, `/todo`, all 38 `/hrms` routes, all
  7 `/attendance` routes, all 18 `/ams` routes, all 5 `/lms` routes, all 11
  `/cha` routes, `/expense`, and all 32 `/accounting` routes.
- Migrated shared surfaces: authenticated user profile menu plus common
  permission, empty, loading, error, and not-found states; People Operations
  workspace; Performance and Learning workspace; Expense and CHA operations
  workspace; Accounting operations workspace; centralized controls, data
  tables, dialogs, navigation, and route states.
- Pending individual route migrations: 93.
- Exhaustive route/layout record: [UI route and layout audit](ui-route-audit.md).

## Status definitions

- **Protected**: authoritative working visual reference; no redesign permitted.
- **Foundation ready**: shared tokens, typography, themes, AppShell, and page
  primitives are ready for route migration.
- **Migrated**: presentation replaced with shared Monolith production
  components and its prior visual source backed up.
- **Verified**: migrated route checked for behavior, RBAC, all themes,
  responsive layout, lint, types, and relevant tests.
- **Pending**: discovered route not yet migrated and verified.

## Route inventory

Route discovery scans `src/app/**/page.tsx`, removes route-group segments,
retains dynamic segments, and calculates layout ancestry. The generated audit is
the route-by-route source of truth.

| Route family         | Discovered | Protected | Migrated | Pending |
| -------------------- | ---------: | --------: | -------: | ------: |
| `/`                  |          1 |         0 |        0 |       1 |
| `/account`           |          1 |         0 |        1 |       0 |
| `/accounting`        |         32 |         0 |       32 |       0 |
| `/admin`             |         10 |         0 |        1 |       9 |
| `/ams`               |         18 |         0 |       18 |       0 |
| `/attendance`        |          7 |         0 |        7 |       0 |
| `/cha`               |         11 |         0 |       11 |       0 |
| `/communication`     |         10 |         0 |        0 |      10 |
| `/crm`               |         57 |         0 |        0 |      57 |
| `/customer-portal`   |         12 |         0 |        0 |      12 |
| `/dashboard`         |          1 |         1 |        0 |       0 |
| `/expense`           |          1 |         0 |        1 |       0 |
| `/google-chat-link`  |          1 |         0 |        0 |       1 |
| `/hrms`              |         38 |         0 |       38 |       0 |
| `/lms`               |          5 |         0 |        5 |       0 |
| `/login`             |          1 |         0 |        0 |       1 |
| `/notifications`     |          1 |         0 |        1 |       0 |
| `/product-catalogue` |          1 |         0 |        1 |       0 |
| `/setup`             |          1 |         0 |        0 |       1 |
| `/todo`              |          1 |         0 |        1 |       0 |
| `/verify`            |          1 |         0 |        0 |       1 |
| **Total**            |    **211** |     **1** |  **117** |  **93** |

An import from `@/components/monolith` is not proof of route migration. A route
remains pending until its rendered presentation and behavior satisfy the
completion gate.

## Layout audit

| Layout                                         | Covered pages | Responsibility                                     |

## Reference design-system analysis

The read-only source under
`_design-reference/Monolith-Design-System-v11-Full-Source-and-Dependencies` was
reviewed without modification or imports.

- `app/page.tsx` is a single interactive catalogue covering foundations,
  typography, actions, forms, surfaces, feedback, data display, navigation, and
  motion.
- `app/globals.css` defines the reference visual language: warm Light surfaces,
  true-neutral Night surfaces, deep-cool Violet surfaces, restrained borders,
  yellow/violet accent hierarchy, compact operational labels, large low-weight
  headings, 4 px base spacing, 12 px controls, 20 px cards, and 160 ms motion.
- `app/layout.tsx` establishes Geist Sans and Geist Mono.
- The reference is a visual specification, not a production dependency.

Production mapping:

- `src/styles/monolith-tokens.css` owns semantic color, surface, border, status,
  typography, spacing, radius, shadow, gradient, and motion tokens.
- `src/styles/monolith-system.css` consumes semantic values through stable
  `--mnx-*` compatibility aliases so the protected dashboard does not change.
- `WorkspaceMetric` follows the reference metric-strip pattern: grouped
  summaries render as one rounded surface with internal dividers, and actionable
  metrics expose an explicit redirect/action icon.
- `WorkspaceSectionHeading` follows the reference numbered-heading layout:
  small accent number, large light title, and muted explanatory copy aligned to
  the right at desktop sizes.
- Night, Violet, Light, and Purple are selected by root `theme-*` classes and
  the shared AppShell keeps `data-theme`, `color-scheme`, and persisted
  preference aligned. Night is the default when no saved user preference exists.

## Foundation implementation

Completed:

- created the exhaustive, repeatable route/layout audit generator;
- created a verified baseline backup of legacy `src/app`, `src/components`, and
  `src/styles`;
- centralized tokens, typography, shape, motion, the original three themes, and
  the additive Purple light theme;
- established `MonolithAppShell` as the shared authenticated shell;
- established shared page, surface, action, badge, icon-action, label, and
  empty-state primitives plus workspace page/table layouts;
- normalized `/dashboard`, its loading state, and its error state to those
  shared primitives while retaining the existing HTML element choices, class
  contracts, business data, interactions, RBAC, and styling;
- kept all pending module routes on their existing shell.

## Quality log: foundation

Passed:

- OLD UI archive verification.
- Targeted ESLint for every changed production TypeScript/TSX file and both
  migration utility scripts.
- Focused TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.ui-migration.json`.
- Production TypeScript: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Relevant Vitest suites: 36 tests across shared primitives, AppShell routing,
  dashboard module behavior, navigation, security, and session security.
- Production build: `npm run build`.
  - Prisma Client generated.
  - Next.js production compilation passed.
  - Production TypeScript passed.
  - 315 static pages generated.

Repository-wide `npm run lint` was also executed with an 8 GB heap. It reaches
pre-existing findings in Prisma seed scripts, maintenance scripts, accounting,
CHA, and other pending module source. The foundation files pass targeted
ESLint; no migration-related lint failure remains. The full scan remains a
repository-quality backlog and was not addressed by changing out-of-scope
modules.

Production TypeScript excludes `*.test.ts(x)` and `__tests__` because test mocks
are executed and type-transformed by Vitest, not shipped by Next.js. The
production program and build pass; known Prisma mock typing debt remains within
the test sources themselves.

The build emits one existing Turbopack NFT trace warning from
`src/app/api/customer-portal/checklist-files/[id]/route.ts`; it is non-fatal and
unrelated to the UI foundation.

## Quality log: batch 001

Passed:

- Verified the batch archive checksum and all 9 archived relative paths.
- Targeted ESLint for every changed TypeScript/TSX file and both updated/new
  migration scripts.
- Focused TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.ui-migration.json`.
- Production TypeScript:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Relevant Vitest suites: 27 tests across shared Monolith primitives, common
  states, shell routing/layout, navigation, and session security.
- Production build:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npm run build`.
  - Prisma Client generated.
  - Next.js production compilation and TypeScript passed.
  - 315 static pages generated.
- Authenticated Playwright verification using the Webpack development server:
  - `/product-catalogue`, `/todo`, and `/notifications`;
  - Light, Night, and Violet themes;
  - 1440×1000 desktop, 1024×900 tablet, and 390×844 mobile;
  - user profile menu and all common state compositions;
  - 45 screenshots with route, theme, legacy-composition, and horizontal
    overflow assertions;
  - Product Catalogue search/module/blueprint interactions, To-Do dialog and
    task expansion, Notifications filters, and profile actions.

The migrated routes have no active imports from the replaced data table,
legacy card/button/input/select/modal composition, no inline color utilities,
and no legacy visual class families. Legacy global form/button/checkbox rules
are explicitly excluded while `data-dashboard-shell="true"` is active.

Repository-wide `npm run lint` was executed with an 8 GB heap. It still reaches
the pre-existing findings in Prisma seed scripts, maintenance scripts,
accounting, CHA, and other pending modules recorded by the foundation handoff.
All batch 001 files pass targeted ESLint.

The build retains the existing non-fatal Turbopack NFT trace warning from the
customer-portal checklist-file route.

## Quality log: batch 002

Passed:

- Verified the batch archive checksum, size, and all 81 archived paths.
- Regenerated the exhaustive route audit: 211 pages, 9 layouts, 49 migrated,
  and 161 pending.
- Static People Operations gate:
  `node scripts/verify-monolith-people-operations-ui.mjs`.
  - all 45 routes and their shared layout/loading/error boundaries;
  - no scoped raw standard controls, legacy data-table/ModuleHome imports,
    custom dialog overlays, legacy visual class families, fixed palette
    utilities, inline hex, or RGB colors;
  - protected biometric sync, punch, overtime server actions, and GPS behavior
    signals retained.
- Targeted ESLint for new shared components, layouts, boundaries, shell,
  verifier scripts, and tests.
- Focused TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.ui-migration.json`.
- Production TypeScript:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Relevant Vitest suites: 20 tests in 7 suites covering foundation,
  workspace, People Operations metadata/composition, shell routing,
  navigation, overtime calculations, and HRMS letters.
- Clean production build:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npm run build`.
  - Prisma Client generated.
  - Next.js production compilation and TypeScript passed.
  - 315 static pages generated.
  - Tailwind discovery is explicitly scoped to `src`, keeping archived and
    scratch visual code out of production compilation.
- Authenticated production Playwright matrix:
  - 45 routes: 38 HRMS and 7 Attendance;
  - Light, Night, and Violet at 1440×1000 desktop;
  - Violet at 1024×900 tablet and Light at 390×844 mobile;
  - 225 route/theme/viewport combinations and 32 representative captures;
  - exact-route, theme, semantic-token, shared-control/table, legacy-class,
    application-error, and horizontal-overflow assertions.

Repository-wide `npm run lint` was executed with an 8 GB heap and reports the
existing repository backlog: 2,147 findings (1,631 errors and 516 warnings) in
seed/maintenance scripts and pending modules. The new batch infrastructure
passes targeted ESLint. Presentation-converted legacy business views retain
their existing `no-explicit-any`, hook-effect, unused-symbol, escaped-text, and
image-rule findings; business behavior was not rewritten merely to mask that
pre-existing debt.

The build retains six non-fatal Turbopack broad file-trace warnings from
existing dynamic filesystem paths in HRMS letter generation, customer-portal
file routes/service code, and the existing NFT trace through `next.config.ts`.
They do not affect compilation or the verified runtime routes.

## Post-batch 002 shell correction

The Monolith workspace sidebar now renders functional, permission-filtered
submenus for every navigation section that has children.

- Parent rows are accessible expand/collapse buttons with `aria-expanded` and
  `aria-controls`.
- The active workspace opens automatically and the most-specific child route
  receives `aria-current`.
- Nested links work in the full desktop sidebar, compact desktop rail, and
  mobile drawer; mobile child navigation closes the drawer.
- Authenticated browser verification covered HRMS, Attendance, To-Do, and AMS,
  including collapse/reopen and nested navigation.
- Targeted ESLint, full TypeScript, 7 navigation/layout tests, and the 8 GB
  production build passed.

## Quality log: batch 003

Passed:

- Verified the batch archive checksum, size, and all 47 archived source paths.
- Regenerated the exhaustive route audit: 211 pages, 11 layouts, 73 migrated,
  and 137 pending.
- Static Performance and Learning gate:
  `node scripts/verify-monolith-performance-learning-ui.mjs`.
  - all 23 routes (18 AMS and 5 LMS), including every dynamic route pattern;
  - shared layouts plus loading and error boundaries;
  - no scoped raw standard controls/tables, legacy data-table/ModuleHome
    imports, custom fixed overlays, legacy visual class families, fixed palette
    utilities, inline hex, or RGB colors;
  - protected appraisal assignment/detail/criteria/self-assessment/management
    review, asset, LMS, and PMS behavior signals retained.
- Targeted ESLint for new shared components, layouts, boundaries, shell,
  rewritten LMS/PMS views, verifier scripts, and tests.
- Focused TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.ui-migration.json`.
- Production TypeScript:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Relevant Vitest suites: 34 tests in 7 suites covering foundation, workspace,
  Performance and Learning metadata/composition, shell routing, navigation,
  and session security.
- Clean production build:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npm run build`.
  - Prisma Client generated.
  - Next.js production compilation and TypeScript passed.
  - 315 static pages generated.
- Authenticated runtime matrix:
  - 23 routes: 18 AMS and 5 LMS;
  - Light, Night, and Violet at 1440×1000 desktop;
  - Violet at 1024×900 tablet and Light at 390×844 mobile;
  - 115 route/theme/viewport combinations and 24 representative captures;
  - exact path, completed route loading, shell/theme, semantic tokens, shared
    controls/tables, no legacy composition, no application errors, and no
    horizontal overflow;
  - real appraisal and employee records exercised the available dynamic
    detail and assignment routes; unavailable management-review, asset,
    self-assessment, and reviewer fixtures were verified through their exact
    authenticated not-found boundaries without mutating business data.

Repository-wide `npm run lint` was executed with an 8 GB heap and reports the
existing repository backlog: 2,120 findings (1,618 errors and 502 warnings) in
seed/maintenance scripts and pending modules. The new batch infrastructure and
rewritten LMS/PMS surfaces pass targeted ESLint. Presentation-converted legacy
AMS business views retain 20 errors and 33 warnings from their existing
`no-explicit-any`, hook-effect, purity, unused-symbol, escaped-text, and image
rules; business behavior was not rewritten merely to mask that debt.

The build retains six non-fatal Turbopack broad file-trace warnings from
existing dynamic filesystem paths in HRMS letter generation, customer-portal
file routes/service code, and the NFT trace through `next.config.ts`. They do
not affect compilation or the verified runtime routes.

## Quality log: batch 004

Passed:

- Archived and verified 37 active legacy Expense/CHA route, view, component,
  and style sources before replacement.
- Regenerated the exhaustive route audit: 211 pages, 12 layouts, 85 migrated,
  and 125 pending.
- Static Expense and CHA gate:
  `node scripts/verify-monolith-expense-cha-ui.mjs`.
  - all 12 routes (11 CHA and 1 Expense), including customer and job dynamic
    route patterns;
  - shared workspace layouts plus loading and error boundaries;
  - no scoped raw standard controls/tables, legacy data-table imports, custom
    fixed overlays, legacy visual class families, fixed-palette utilities,
    inline hex, or RGB colors;
  - protected job stages, prerequisites, approvals, documents, filing,
    expenses, RBAC, and server-action signals retained.
- Targeted ESLint for the new shared workspace infrastructure, layouts,
  boundaries, shell, verifier scripts, and tests.
- Focused TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.ui-migration.json`.
- Production TypeScript:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Monolith workspace/foundation/shell Vitest suites: 14 tests in 4 suites.
- CHA checklist and date-extension focused suites: 12 tests in 2 suites.
- Production build:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npm run build`.
  - Prisma Client generated.
  - Next.js production compilation and TypeScript passed.
  - 315 static pages generated.

The broader CHA integration suite completed 24 of 27 tests. Its three failures
are fixture/environment expectations outside this presentation migration: an
unavailable Google Drive checklist attachment, a null `estimatedFilingDate`
fixture, and an audit-event name mismatch (`JOB_DELETE_EXECUTED` is emitted
where the test expects `JOB_DELETED_DIRECT`). No workflow behavior was changed
to force those tests green.

Repository-wide lint was executed with an 8 GB heap and reports the existing
backlog: 2,117 findings (1,617 errors and 500 warnings). The batch-scoped
legacy business views retain 375 errors and 71 warnings, concentrated in the
large job workspace and workflow builder, from their existing
`no-explicit-any`, hook-effect, unused-symbol, and related business-code debt.
New batch infrastructure passes targeted ESLint.

Blocked:

- The connected in-app Browser service returned no browser instance
  (`agent.browsers.list()` returned an empty list). Therefore the required
  authenticated Light, Night, and Violet checks at desktop, tablet, and mobile
  widths have not been performed.
- Batch 004 is intentionally not marked Verified and has not been committed as
  a verified batch. Once a Browser instance is available, exercise all 12
  routes, including loaded dynamic job/customer fixtures and every dialog,
  drawer, filing stage, theme, and viewport, then commit only if that matrix
  passes.

## Post-batch 004 shared popup correction

Implemented on 2026-07-29 in response to the oversized create-job workspace and
the same popup contract used throughout migrated Monolith routes.

- Consolidated `WorkspaceDialog`, the general `Modal` adapter, and
  `ChaDialogLayer` onto one portal, backdrop, focus, keyboard, and document
  scroll-lock implementation.
- Replaced the fixed 56rem CHA workspace height with shared compact, default,
  wide, and workspace sizes. Workspace dialogs are capped at 52rem and 88dvh
  on desktop, keeping surrounding context and close/actions visible.
- Kept headers and footers outside the scrollable content region for standard
  dialogs. The create-job workspace retains one bounded form-content scroller
  instead of scrolling the entire overlay and form independently.
- Added safe-area-aware mobile bottom-sheet behavior and full-width actions,
  while desktop and tablet dialogs remain centered and inset.
- Added accessible title/description relationships, Escape handling, focus
  containment, trigger-focus restoration, stacked-dialog-safe body locking,
  scrollbar compensation, and backdrop dismissal.
- Stabilized inline close callbacks so typing or other popup state changes do
  not restart the dialog lifecycle or steal focus.
- Replaced the context-specific default `People operations` modal eyebrow with
  the neutral `Workspace action` label for shared dialogs used by AMS, CHA, and
  Expense.
- Scanned all migrated route and component sources. No route-local
  `fixed inset-0` popup remains; migrated modal workflows delegate to the
  centralized layer. The AppShell mobile navigation drawer remains its own
  centralized navigation primitive.

Backup:
`OLD UI code/legacy-ui-before-monolith-popup-fix-20260729-384cfad.zip`

- Five pre-correction sources with relative paths retained.
- Size: 44,608 bytes.
- SHA-256:
  `6ED2CAF2AB94813E0BB5235B847C39DA9762FE7154E065EB4D595508FB2DE119`.
- Checksum, exact five-file listing, and required entries pass through the
  Expense/CHA static verifier.

Passed:

- updated static Expense/CHA and centralized popup contract gate;
- targeted ESLint for the shared dialog, modal adapter, CHA adapter, verifier,
  and popup contract test;
- full production TypeScript with the required 8 GB Node heap;
- 16 tests in 5 Monolith workspace, popup, foundation, and shell suites;
- production build with the required 8 GB Node heap, including Prisma
  generation, Next.js compilation, production TypeScript, and 315 static
  pages.

Blocked:

- The connected Browser service again returned no available browser instance
  (`agent.browsers.list()` returned `[]`). Live Light, Night, and Violet
  verification at desktop, tablet, and mobile widths is therefore still
  pending for representative To-Do, HRMS, Attendance, AMS, Expense, and CHA
  dialogs, including the create-job workspace shown in the defect report.

## Quality log: batch 005

Passed:

- Discovered all 32 Accounting routes directly from
  `src/app/(dashboard)/accounting/**/page.tsx`, including five dynamic detail
  patterns and the commercial-document aliases absent from a simple sidebar
  inventory.
- Archived the active legacy Accounting presentation and its CRM/item visual
  dependencies before replacement. The repeatable static gate verifies the
  archive checksum, size, 68-file listing, and required paths.
- Added the shared Accounting workspace layout, loading/error boundaries,
  metadata, route headers, metrics, sections, toolbars, tables, dialogs,
  record cards, details, statuses, and semantic responsive styles.
- Centralized specialized invoice form/detail, commercial-document form,
  item catalogue/form/detail, and delete-action components instead of
  duplicating route-local visual implementations.
- Preserved Accounting and CRM server actions, Prisma/service reads, RBAC,
  validation, ledger posting controls, allocation behavior, CSV/JSON
  import/export, quotations and note conversion/submission, and commercial
  document integrations.
- Removed active Accounting imports from the legacy CRM invoice form, legacy
  CRM delete button, and legacy shared item presentation.
- Regenerated the exhaustive audit: 211 pages, 13 layouts, 117 migrated, and
  93 pending.
- Static UI/archive/workflow gate:
  `node scripts/verify-monolith-accounting-ui.mjs`.
- Targeted ESLint for all Accounting route sources, shared specialized
  components, shell/audit/runtime verifiers, and focused tests.
- Production TypeScript:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Five focused Vitest suites: 22 tests covering Accounting services, shared
  workspace composition, centralized workspace/dialog contracts, and shell
  routing.
- Production build:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npm run build`.
  - Prisma Client generated.
  - Next.js compilation and production TypeScript passed.
  - 315 static pages generated.
  - The six existing broad filesystem/NFT trace warnings remain non-fatal and
    originate outside Accounting.
- Authenticated Playwright runtime gate:
  `node scripts/verify-monolith-accounting-runtime.mjs --use-local-special-account`.
  - all 32 exact routes, including loaded dynamic item, journal, payment,
    sales-invoice, and purchase-invoice details;
  - Light, Night, and Violet themes at 1440×1000 desktop, 1024×900 tablet, and
    390×844 mobile;
  - 288 route/theme/viewport combinations and 72 representative screenshots;
  - exact paths, completed route/header state, active theme and semantic
    tokens, centralized controls/tables, no legacy composition, no browser or
    server errors, and no page-level horizontal overflow;
  - mobile quotation-dialog viewport bounds and Escape dismissal;
  - temporary dynamic-route fixtures were inserted with unique test IDs,
    removed in the verifier's `finally` cleanup, and independently confirmed
    absent after the run.
- `git diff --check`.
